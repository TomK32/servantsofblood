**Fortress Middle Management: Servants of Blood** is a game focusing on
one aspect that *Dwarf Fortress* neglects heavily. In Servants of Blood
you will play the role of a dwarf in middle management. You must be
eager to assign the tasks at hand to the right dwarf. You never stop
looking for fresh blood to immigrate into to your fortress (children
welcome). You will enjoy your pie charts, shift tables, de-briefment
reports, and drafting new Health & Safety guidelines. And make sure you
never run out of office supplies.
